            <h2>About Me
            </h2>
            <p> started my journey from zero, driven by curiosity and consistency. Step by step, I learned how to structure clean pages, design layouts, and understand how websites really work. I’m currently focused on strengthening: HTML — clean structure
                and semantic elements CSS — layouts, spacing, and responsive design Git & GitHub — version control and project tracking JavaScript — core concepts and problem-solving My goal is simple: to become a front-end developer with clean code,
                solid skills, and real projects</p>

            <h3>My Coding Journey</h3>
            <p>> My journey is built on practice. Every day, I learn something new — even if it's small. I create mini-projects, improve previous ones, and push all my work to GitHub to track my progress. I learned how important consistency is, and how every
                mistake is part of the process. Right now, I’m focusing on: mastering layouts (Flexbox & Grid) writing cleaner CSS improving responsive design building real projects from scratch
